How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
It was easier to concentrate on what had changed alone and not in the entirety of the
document without knowing what was the same and what was new.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I can see what changes I have made and realize if I make common mistakes. Also, I can see how the progress of my work is. I do not need to redo anything I can just go back to a previous version if I feel the new one if wrong. If I make several changes in different parts of the document, it is easier to track it down and I can see where I need to make changes in case I need to incorporate something new.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

PROS:
- I get to choose when to save things so that many versions are not stored without any use.
CONS:
- If I forget to save, then there will be a lot of changes that could basically make the two files not seem as a progression but as a beginning and end.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because Git is more specialized. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can follow which lines were changed from one version to another.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

much more confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

everything!
